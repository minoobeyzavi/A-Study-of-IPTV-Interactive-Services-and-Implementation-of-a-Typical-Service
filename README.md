# Interactive Services
An interactive service is one that enables user to receive a transmission of data specially created for the recipient, or upon request, whether or not as part of a program, which is selected by or on behalf of the recipient.
Interactive services present users with various capabilities. The service provider can combine these capabilities with other services to create two-way communications with the client. The application is implemented to be used on a platform, however it has the least confluence with the main processes of its platform and independently runs and interacts with the user.
